"""The composed developmental pipeline: genome → θ → x* → landmarks → shape.

This is the spine of docs/DESIGN.md §2, wired end to end::

    a  ──[A: GRN/MLP]──▶  θ  ──[B: relax to x*]──▶  x*  ──[C: Procrustes]──▶  z
         genome_map            mechanical               phenotype

and its Jacobian, assembled by the chain rule from the three layers:

    ∂z/∂a  =  (∂z/∂x*) · (∂x*/∂θ) · (∂θ/∂a)
              readout     implicit      autodiff

Only the middle factor needs the implicit function theorem — it is the only one
with a solve inside it. The outer two are explicit functions, so plain autodiff
is not merely adequate there, it is exact.

The two load-bearing interfaces are θ and z (DESIGN.md §2), which is why they are
plain arrays: every layer here is swappable without touching its neighbours.
