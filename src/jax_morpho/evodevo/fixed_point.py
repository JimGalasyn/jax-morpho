"""Implicit sensitivity of a developmental equilibrium — the Phase 1 engine.

Development is written as a fixed point ``F(x*, θ) = 0``. By the implicit
function theorem the developmental sensitivity is

    ∂x*/∂θ = −[∂F/∂x]⁻¹ [∂F/∂θ]

costing **one linear solve per parameter**, independent of how many relaxation
steps were taken to reach x*. Energy minimisation (``F = −∇E``) is the default
instance, but the engine is written against the general fixed point so it also
covers non-potential and growth-driven development (docs/DESIGN.md §1).

The gauge problem
-----------------
For a mechanical tissue this inverse **does not exist**. The energy depends only
on pairwise distances, so it is invariant under rigid motions of the whole
tissue, and at a true equilibrium ``∂F/∂x`` is exactly singular with a
3-dimensional null space in 2D: two translations and one rotation. (Measured on
a converged 12-cell blob: eigenvalues ``[0, 0, 0, 3.19, 6.00, ...]``.) A plain
``jnp.linalg.solve`` is not merely inaccurate here — the system is degenerate.

The resolution is the **pseudo-inverse**: the minimum-norm solution, which is
exactly the one with no rigid-motion component. Because E is rigid-invariant for
every θ, ``∂F/∂θ`` is orthogonal to the null space too, so the system is
consistent and the pseudo-inverse solves it exactly rather than in a
least-squares sense.

That choice is not free, and the difference is measurable (see
``tests/test_fixed_point.py::TestGaugeIsRotationOnly``). A pairwise
central-force gradient step carries zero net force and zero net torque, so each
step is orthogonal to the *current* rigid modes. Integrating that along a path
gives two different answers:

* **Translation** is genuinely conserved: the centre of mass of x*(θ) is that of
  the initial condition, to 1e-15, for every θ. The pseudo-inverse agrees.
* **Rotation is not.** Zero torque at every instant does *not* integrate to zero
  net rotation, because the modes rotate with the shape as it changes — a
  geometric phase, the same anholonomy that lets a falling cat land on its feet
  with zero angular momentum throughout. Finite-differencing the relaxation
  therefore reports a large rotational component (~0.45 against a Jacobian of
  scale ~1.3) that no fixed-point method can reproduce, because it is not a
  property of the fixed point at all. Its *size* depends on the path: changing
  the solver's step schedule moved it from ~5.2 to ~0.45 while leaving the
  gauge-invariant sensitivity untouched, which is the clearest statement of what
  it is.

So the equilibrium **form** is a function of θ, while its **orientation** is a
functional of the entire developmental trajectory. This is why the phenotype
readout is Procrustes-aligned landmarks (DESIGN.md §2C): the alignment is not
tidying-up before comparison, it is what makes the phenotype a well-defined
function of the genotype in the first place. The gauge is a property of the
representation, not of the form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    F : callable ``F(x, theta) -> array`` shaped like ``x``
        The developmental residual. For energy relaxation, ``F = −∇E``.
    x_star : array
        A converged fixed point. **Must** satisfy ``F(x*, θ) ≈ 0``; this is not
        checked here (see :func:`~jax_morpho.evodevo.mechanical.equilibrate`,
        which reports its residual).
    theta : array, shape (m,)
    solver : {"pinv", "cg"}
        ``pinv`` forms ``∂F/∂x`` densely and applies the pseudo-inverse: exact,
        gauge-safe, O(n³) — the reference path and the one gate #1 validates.
        ``cg`` is matrix-free (Hessian-vector products, no matrix formed) and
        projects the rigid modes out of the Krylov space; it requires ``∂F/∂x``
        to be symmetric negative-semidefinite, i.e. an energy minimum. This is
        the path that scales.
    null_basis : array, shape (n, k), optional
        Orthonormal basis of known exact zero modes (see :func:`rigid_modes`).
        Required by ``cg``; optional for ``pinv``, which discovers the null
        space itself via ``rcond``.
